# Hello World!

This is my first post on my new blog which is build with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) and is powered by [Netlify](https://netlify.com)!

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on [React](https://reactjs.org) that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps 
and Netlify is the fastest way to build the fastest sites.

The continuous deployment via the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pitufocabeza/developers-playground-material) of this blog makes
development and writing a breeze.

```python
def hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
hello()
```
